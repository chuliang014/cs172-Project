# cs172-Project
Information Retrieval
# Running
using the command for crawling data:
```
./crawlerShell.sh
```
# Lucene Index
To start the program, you need to ensure you have node.js in your system.
First, we just go into the project directory and give the permission for two files called indexsearch.sh and startweb.sh using the command below,
```
chmod +x indexsearch.sh startweb.sh
```
Second, we run the indexsearch.sh like this,
```
./indexsearch.sh
```
In this way, you can index the file and start http server.

Third, we run the startweb.sh,
```
./startweb.sh
```
At this point, you start the web client, so you can search any content you want.
In addition, you can use the url below to access the web,
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
